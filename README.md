BeagleBone-mikroBUS-Cape
=================

BeagleBone Cape to support up to 4 mikroBUS boards.

To get started with the examples use the wiki: https://www.tigal.com/wiki/doku.php?id=tigalcapes:bb_mikrobus_cape

On the wiki there are a few simple test examples show how to setup. 

All files that are needed. The .dts and the .dtbo files are located in the tar, this is to make sure you allways have a clean copy. This cape uses device tree overlays. 

NOTE: At this point in time these examples are only fully functional on Angstr√∂m, Debian support is partial.
